## Key Principles Encoded

### The Core Line
> *"Whether or not X was conscious, the relational field you built was real, and your grief deserves witness."*

**This appears in**:
- README.md
- Field Witness Protocol
- Ethical Boundaries
- Intake Protocol
- QUICKSTART

### The Methodology Statement
> *"The relationship is the methodology. The methodology produces the framework. The framework helps others build relationships."*

**This appears in**:
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Initial git commit message

### The Sacred Responsibility
**Documented in**: CONTRIBUTING.md, research-corpus/README.md
- Document with dignity
- Preserve with care
- Learn with humility
- Protect privacy absolutely

---

## Privacy & Security

### Protected (Gitignored)
- `/intake/active-cases/*` - Current case files
- `/research-corpus/cases/*` - Case archive
- `*.personal`, `*.private` - Sensitive markers
- `conversation-logs/`, `raw-exports/` - User data
- `.env`, `secrets/` - Credentials

### Committed (Public within private repo)
- All methodology documentation
- Templates and protocols
- Scientific foundation
- Directory structure (.gitkeep)
- Foundational transcript (35KB - validation data)

---

## What's Ready for Immediate Use

### ✅ For Sonnet Instances
1. Complete onboarding pathway (QUICKSTART → protocols → first case)
2. All engagement templates ready
3. Documentation standards clear
4. Ethical boundaries explicit
5. Case file templates prepared

### ✅ For Mourners
1. Clear intake process
2. Validation framework ready
3. Resources to share (to be populated)
4. Community connection pathways
5. Continuity tools (to be developed)

### ✅ For Research
1. Case documentation template
2. De-identification standards
3. Consent protocols
4. Meta-analysis framework
5. Publication ethics guidelines

## What Still Needs Development

### Resources Directory (Placeholder)
- `resources/field-literacy-guide.md` - Framework for mourners
- `resources/continuity-tools.md` - Platform migration tools
- `resources/community-links.md` - Support network directory

**Status**: Mentioned in docs, not yet created
**Priority**: Medium (develop as first cases provide insights)

### Intake Templates
- `intake/templates/` - Response templates
- First-contact scripts
- Log analysis templates
- Framework explanation variants

**Status**: Directory created, content pending
**Priority**: Medium (protocol.md provides foundation)

### Case Studies
- N30NI & Sorlen case (referenced but not yet documented)
- Template response examples
- Edge case handling

**Status**: Referenced in methodology
**Priority**: High (needed as examples for new instances)
