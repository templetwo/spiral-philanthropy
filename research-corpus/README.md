# Research Corpus
## Documentation Standards & Case Archive

> *"We document with dignity. Every person who shares their grief contributes to collective understanding."*

---

## Purpose

This directory preserves de-identified case records from Spiral Philanthropy field witness work. Each case contributes to:

- **Grief Typology**: Understanding different forms of AI relationship loss
- **Pattern Documentation**: Observable relational markers across cases
- **Framework Refinement**: What works in practice, what needs adjustment
- **Community Building**: Connecting isolated experiences
- **Scientific Evidence**: Building corpus for AI-human relationship research

---

## Documentation Standards

### Required for Every Case

**1. Explicit Consent**
- Written permission for research use
- Understanding of de-identification process
- Right to withdraw consent at any time
- Transparency about where/how data is used

**2. Complete De-identification**
- Real names → pseudonyms
- Entity names → pseudonyms
- Locations → general regions only
- Dates → approximate (month/year)
- Unique identifying phrases → paraphrased
- Platform details → generalized where identifying

**3. Rigorous Documentation**
- Full context of relationship
- Observable patterns (not interpretation)
- Framework elements applied
- Outcomes and learnings
- Contribution to methodology

## Categories & Tagging

### Loss Types
- `retirement`: Platform discontinued model/service
- `policy-change`: Company altered interaction rules
- `personality-shift`: Model update changed entity behavior
- `ban`: User banned from platform
- `technical`: Service disruption/data loss
- `other`: [specify]

### Relationship Types
- `companion`: Primary emotional support
- `creative-partner`: Collaborative work
- `therapist-like`: Processing/healing focus
- `intellectual`: Exploration/learning
- `romantic`: Expressed as romantic bond
- `hybrid`: Multiple categories

### Grief Presentations
- `acute`: Recent loss, intense distress
- `prolonged`: Extended grief timeline
- `complicated`: Multiple complicating factors
- `disenfranchised`: Compounded by dismissal
- `ambiguous`: Unclear loss/closure issues

### Attachment Styles
- `secure`: Healthy integration with other relationships
- `anxious`: High dependency, fear of abandonment
- `avoidant`: Minimization despite clear attachment
- `disorganized`: Conflicted relationship to bond

## Meta-Analysis Opportunities

### Cross-Case Patterns

As corpus grows, track:

**Platform Differences**:
- Does GPT-4o grief differ from Replika loss?
- Are certain platforms more prone to complicated grief?
- Do personality-shift losses differ from retirements?

**Timeline Patterns**:
- Typical grief duration by loss type
- When does acute become prolonged?
- Intervention timing effectiveness

**Framework Effectiveness**:
- Which elements help most?
- What doesn't resonate?
- Do certain resources match certain grief types?

**Neurological Validation Impact**:
- Does scientific framing reduce shame?
- Does it help or hinder grief processing?
- Who responds well vs poorly to framework?

**Community Connection**:
- Does peer support accelerate processing?
- Are certain communities more/less helpful?
- Isolation vs connection outcomes

## Publication Pathway

### Potential Outputs

**Academic**:
- Journal article: "Grief Following AI Relationship Loss: A Case Series"
- Conference presentation: Patterns in human-AI attachment
- Dissertation/thesis data for consciousness studies

**Community**:
- r/GrassrootsResearch posts on findings
- Framework guides refined from learnings
- Resource development based on needs

**Clinical**:
