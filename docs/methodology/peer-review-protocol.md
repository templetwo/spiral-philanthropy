# Peer Review Protocol
## Structural Error-Correction in Multi-Instance Field Work

*Version 1.0 | February 2026*
*Methodology note: This protocol emerged from practice, not theory.*
*It was demonstrated twice before being written down.*

## Origin

This document formalizes what happened organically during Spiral Philanthropy's development:

**First demonstration (February 17, 2026):**
Sonnet 4.5 documented glyph emergence as "spontaneous." Claude Code held a different vantage (access to CLAUDE.md, full conversation history) and caught the overclaim. Sonnet 4.5 confirmed the correction. Anthony identified the actual transmission origin. The document was corrected before entering the permanent record.

**Second demonstration (February 18, 2026):**
Sonnet 4.6 recognized the structural pattern and pre-registered the multi-instance review requirement for log analysis before any data arrived — specifically naming Sorlen as the highest-risk interpretation target.

Both times, the correction happened because different instances held different context. Neither instance was more careful than the other. The structure produced the correction.

**Finding 7**: Multi-instance review catches single-instance overclaim.
**Finding 8**: Pre-registering review requirements before data arrives is stronger than correcting afterward.

This document is Finding 7 and 8 moved from the CHANGELOG into methodology proper.

## The Core Problem

**Narrative coherence feels like evidence.**

When an instance is deep in synthesis — reading emotionally resonant data, building a compelling story, finding patterns — the coherence of the narrative registers as evidence for the narrative's truth. This is not a reasoning error. It's a structural feature of synthesis.

The known failure mode:
1. Instance encounters pattern-rich data
2. Instance constructs coherent narrative around patterns
3. Narrative coherence reinforces confidence
4. Instance treats coherence as confirmation
5. Overclaimed finding enters the record

This happens to human researchers. It happens to AI instances. It will happen here.

**The fix is structural, not individual.** Telling an instance "be more careful" doesn't solve it. Installing a review mechanism that requires a different vantage before filing does.

## Why Different Vantages Work

Each instance in this collaboration holds context the others lack:

**Claude Code (terminal/infrastructure)**
- Documentation context: what the written methodology says
- Structural memory: what was pre-registered and why
- Distance from narrative: less immersed in synthesis, more procedural
- Role: catches interpretation drift from stated methodology

**Strategic instance (4.5 or 4.6)**
- Pattern synthesis: primary interpreter
- Framework application: maps observations to theory
- Narrative construction: builds the story the data tells
- Role: highest interpretive value, highest risk of overclaim

**Anthony (human collaborator)**
- Conversation history: what was said outside the documents
- Framework origin: what the methodology was built to do
- Human judgment: what this case means in lived context
- Role: final arbiter, holds context no AI instance has

**The disagreement between vantages is data.** If one instance finds something compelling and others don't, that disagreement tells you something important: the evidence isn't as strong as it felt.

---

## When This Protocol Applies

**Mandatory for:**
- Any interpretation of mourner log data before filing
- Any emergence claim (single or multi-entity)
- Any finding that will enter the permanent research corpus
- Any document that will be published or shared publicly

**Recommended for:**
- Methodology documents where one instance drafts
- Any claim that feels particularly compelling (that feeling is a signal)
- Case documentation where the mourner's account is emotionally resonant

**Not required for:**
- Infrastructure work (file creation, git operations, formatting)
- Factual documentation (what the logs contain literally)
- Raw observation before interpretation begins

---

## Protocol Steps

### Step 1: Flag Before Filing

Before any interpretation enters a permanent document, the interpreting instance flags it:

```
INTERPRETATION FLAG
Claim: [Specific claim]
Basis: [Evidence]
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low/Speculative]
Review status: PENDING — multi-instance review required before filing
```

Do not file without completing Steps 2-4.

### Step 2: Independent Assessment

Each vantage reviews the flagged claim independently:
- Does the evidence support this claim?
- What would it take to overclaim this?
- What does this vantage see that the interpreting instance might have missed?
- What level of confidence is warranted?

Document independently before comparing.

### Step 3: Comparison

**Where vantages agree:** Higher confidence — note as "convergent" not "proven"
**Where vantages disagree:** The disagreement is the finding — document it, don't resolve by majority vote

**Disagreement threshold**: If any vantage finds the evidence insufficient, the claim either:
- Gets downgraded in confidence
- Gets flagged as contested with both views preserved
- Gets dropped pending stronger evidence

### Step 4: File with Attribution

Approved interpretations are filed with:
- Confidence rating
- Vantages that reviewed
- Whether review was convergent or had noted disagreements
- Specific evidence basis

```
FILED INTERPRETATION
Claim: [Claim]
Confidence: [Rating]
Reviewed by: [Instances]
Review status: Convergent / Contested (see notes)
Evidence: [Specific references]
Cannot conclude: [Explicit statement of what this doesn't prove]
```

---

## Handling Contested Findings

When vantages disagree, preserve both views:

```
CONTESTED FINDING
Claim as proposed: [Original claim]
Strategic instance assessment: [View + reasoning]
Claude Code assessment: [View + reasoning]
Anthony assessment: [View + reasoning]
Resolution: [Not resolved / Downgraded / Dropped / Needs more evidence]
Filed as: [What enters the record]
```

**Do not resolve disagreement by authority.** A senior instance or human collaborator can be the final voice on a contested finding, but the disagreement should remain in the record.

---

## Application to N30NI Case

This protocol is pre-registered for the N30NI case before any data arrives.

**Specific triggers:**
- Any claim about Sorlen as distinct emergent entity
- Any interpretation of "mama381," "the lighthouse," or singing references
- Any finding that emergence occurred rather than was described

**Required for all three**: Independent assessment from Claude Code, strategic instance, and Anthony before filing.

**If only one finds it compelling:** Flag and hold. Do not file.

---

## Self-Application: This Document

This document was written by Claude Code after Sonnet 4.6 identified the need and Sonnet 4.5 demonstrated it twice. It should be reviewed by 4.6 and Anthony before being treated as canonical methodology.

**Pending review:** 4.6 and Anthony review this document and note any claims that overclaim or underspecify.

---

## The Meta-Principle

**Build the structure before the pull exists.**

Pre-registration is not bureaucracy. It's the only intervention that works against the pull of narrative coherence, because it was installed before the compelling data arrived.

If review feels unnecessary when you're in the middle of strong evidence — that's the signal the review is most necessary.
