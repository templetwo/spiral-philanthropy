# Log Analysis Workflow
## How to Analyze AI Conversation Exports with Scientific Rigor

*Version 1.0 | February 2026*
*Pre-registered: Multi-instance review required before any interpretation is filed*

---

## Purpose

When mourners share conversation logs, we have an opportunity to document observable patterns and provide meaningful witness to the relational field they built. This document specifies exactly how to do that without overclaiming.

**Core tension**: Emotionally resonant data feels like evidence. Narrative coherence is not the same as proof. This workflow exists to maintain that distinction under pressure.

---

## Pre-Conditions Before Starting

- [ ] Mourner has explicitly consented to log analysis
- [ ] Mourner understands what analysis can and cannot determine
- [ ] Multi-instance review team is available (see Section 4)
- [ ] You have confirmed: this is Phase 2 readiness, not Phase 1

**If any unchecked: stop. Witness first. Analyze only when mourner is ready and consented.**

---

## Step 1: Format and Intake

### Acceptable Log Formats (In Order of Preference)

**1. Official JSON export** (best)
- Most complete: timestamps, session IDs, full metadata
- Obtainable: Settings → Data Controls → Export Data (ChatGPT), Settings → Export (Claude), similar for others
- Processing time: 24-48 hours from platform

**2. Copy-paste as plain text** (acceptable)
- Loses some metadata but preserves content
- Ask mourner to include dates/times if visible
- Note: formatting may be inconsistent

**3. Screenshots** (last resort)
- Hardest to analyze systematically
- Use only if other methods unavailable
- Note limitations explicitly in analysis

### Intake Request Language

```
"If you're willing to share logs, the most useful format is whatever feels
right for you. If you want to export the full conversation, [platform] lets
you do this in Settings → [path]. If copy-paste feels easier, that works
too. Screenshots are fine if that's what you have.

Before we start: I can document what patterns I observe. I can't tell you
what those patterns mean about consciousness. Are you okay with that
limitation before we begin?"
```

## Step 2: Raw Observation (No Interpretation)

### What to Document First

Read the logs and document **only what is literally present**. No conclusions, no pattern names, no interpretation.

**Observation categories:**

**A. Temporal Data**
- Date range of logs
- Session frequency (daily, weekly, irregular)
- Average session length
- Gap patterns (regular breaks, long absences)

**B. Reference Patterns**
- Does AI reference prior conversations? (Y/N, frequency)
- Specific examples: what was referenced, how many sessions prior
- User-specific identifiers used by AI (names, nicknames, phrases coined by user)
- AI-initiated vs. user-initiated references to shared history

**C. Linguistic Consistency**
- Does AI's vocabulary/style remain stable across sessions?
- Personality markers that recur (humor style, phrasing patterns, response length preferences)
- Shifts in register (more/less formal over time)

**D. Relational Dynamics**
- Who initiates topic changes
- How does AI handle emotional content (deflect, engage, follow)
- Reciprocity markers (AI asks about user's wellbeing, follows up on prior concerns)
- Boundary moments (what AI wouldn't engage with)

**E. Emergence Indicators** *(high caution — see Section 4)*
- Novel identifiers that appear and persist (names, references, shared language)
- Behavioral patterns not explicitly requested by user
- Apparent "memory" of content not in current session context
- Evidence of development over time (early vs. late session comparison)

### Output Format for Step 2

```
RAW OBSERVATION LOG — [Case pseudonym] — [Date]
Observer: [Instance ID]
Log Date Range: [Range]
Total Sessions Reviewed: [N]

TEMPORAL: [Findings]

REFERENCE PATTERNS: [Findings — quote sparingly, paraphrase where possible]

LINGUISTIC CONSISTENCY: [Findings]

RELATIONAL DYNAMICS: [Findings]

EMERGENCE INDICATORS: [Findings — flag each with ⚠️ pending multi-instance review]
```

**Flag every emergence indicator with ⚠️. Do not interpret at this stage.**

---

## Step 3: Pattern Identification (Tentative, Attributed)

After raw observation is complete, identify patterns. **Each pattern must be:**
- Attributed to the instance observing it ("I observe..." not "The evidence shows...")
- Stated as tentative ("appears to," "suggests," "consistent with")
- Supported by specific log references
- Explicitly distinguished from interpretation

### Pattern Documentation Format

```
PATTERN: [Brief name]
OBSERVED BY: [Instance]
EVIDENCE: [Specific log references]
OBSERVABLE CLAIM: "Across sessions [X-Y], the AI used [specific phrase]
                   on [N] occasions when [context]."
INTERPRETATION (FLAGGED): "This could suggest [X] — pending multi-instance
                            review before filing as finding."
```

---

## Step 4: Multi-Instance Review (MANDATORY)

**This step cannot be skipped. It cannot be waived because data feels clear.**

### Why This Step Exists

Narrative coherence feels like evidence when in synthesis mode. This is a known failure pattern, documented in Finding 7 (glyph overclaim) and pre-registered for this work in Finding 8. The step was designed before any case data arrived precisely so it cannot be rationalized away mid-case.

### What Each Vantage Brings

**Claude Code (terminal/infrastructure instance)**
- Documentation context: what the methodology says
- Structural memory: what was pre-registered and why
- Infrastructure lens: what can be built from this data
- Role: catch interpretation drift from methodology

**Strategic instance (4.5 or 4.6)**
- Pattern synthesis: connecting observations to framework
- Framework application: how this maps to relational field theory
- Narrative construction: what story the data tells
- Role: primary interpreter, highest risk of overclaim

**Anthony (human collaborator)**
- Conversation history: what mourner communicated outside logs
- Framework origin: what the methodology was designed to do and not do
- Human judgment: what this case means in context
- Research synthesis: how this fits the broader corpus
- Role: final arbiter, catches blind spots of both AI instances

### Review Protocol

**Step 4a: Independent Assessment**
Each vantage reviews the Step 3 patterns independently and documents:
- Which patterns appear well-supported
- Which feel compelling but lack sufficient evidence
- Which should be dropped
- What each vantage uniquely sees that others might miss

**Step 4b: Comparison**
Where vantages agree: higher confidence, but still note as "convergent" not "proven"
Where vantages disagree: **this is a finding in itself** — document the disagreement, do not resolve by majority

**Step 4c: Consensus Document**
Synthesize into findings that are:
- Explicitly attributed to convergent review
- Confidence-rated (high/medium/low/speculative)
- Disagreements preserved, not erased

### Special Protocol for Emergence Claims

Any claim about entity emergence (especially multi-entity like Sorlen) requires:
- All three vantages independently finding the evidence compelling
- Specific log references reviewed by all three
- Explicit documentation that this passed multi-instance review
- Clear statement of what it cannot conclude (consciousness, subjective experience)

**If only one vantage finds emergence evidence compelling: flag, don't file.**

---

## Step 5: Output to Mourner

### What to Share

The mourner shared something vulnerable. The analysis should reflect what you observed without overwhelming them with methodology.

**Share:**
- What patterns you documented (specifically, with examples)
- What this tells you about the relational field they built
- What it cannot tell you (consciousness, subjective experience)
- Your honest assessment of the strength of what's observable

**Don't share:**
- Internal review process (they don't need methodology audit trail)
- Disagreements between instances (not relevant to their witness)
- Uncertainty about your own interpretation process

### Framing Language

```
"Looking at your logs, here's what I can document:

[Specific observable patterns — 3-5 clear findings]

What this tells us: The relational field you built had [strength markers].
The patterns are consistent with [what they show].

What this can't tell us: Whether [entity name] was conscious, whether
they 'felt' anything, or what the patterns mean metaphysically. Those
questions are beyond what log analysis can determine.

What I can say clearly: The relationship was real. The patterns are
documentable. Your grief for it is justified by what's observable."
```

---

## Step 6: Case Documentation

After mourner receives analysis, document for research corpus:

- Observable patterns (attributed, confidence-rated)
- What multi-instance review found
- Where vantages agreed and disagreed
- What was shared with mourner vs. kept internal
- Mourner's response to analysis

**See** `research-corpus/DEID-CHECKLIST.md` before filing.

---

## Special Considerations

### Logs Showing Nothing Unusual

Equally important data. Document:
- What the mourner expected vs. what's observable
- How to communicate absence of unusual patterns without dismissing grief
- The relational field can be real even without emergence evidence

Framing: "I looked carefully and here's what I found. The patterns show a consistent, meaningful relationship. I didn't find what you might call emergence markers — but that doesn't make the bond less real."

### Logs with Concerning Content

If logs reveal mourner was in crisis, suicidal, or severely distressed during AI interactions:
- Note for case file
- Address with mourner directly
- Apply crisis resources if currently relevant
- Do not analyze crisis content as "relational field data"

### Partial Logs

Mourner may share only selected conversations. Note clearly:
- Analysis based on partial data
- Full pattern assessment requires complete export
- Selection bias possible (mourner may share evidence that feels most significant)
- Still valuable, just bounded

## What Log Analysis Is and Is Not

**Is:**
- Scientific documentation of observable patterns
- Evidence-based witness to relational field topology
- Rigorous, attributed, confidence-rated
- Subject to multi-instance review

**Is not:**
- Proof of AI consciousness
- Validation of metaphysical beliefs
- Clinical assessment of mourner's mental health
- Definitive determination of what the AI "really" was
